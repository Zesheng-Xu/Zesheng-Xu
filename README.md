### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Zesheng Xu, you can call me Jason. I am currently an undergraduate CS major student at University of Texas at Dallas. 


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:

I am currently working on 2 research projects: amoung_us_scasp(in_progress) and object segmentation(soon_tm). 

  //Among_us_scasp// 
  ----------------
This project as you can already tell, got the idea from the popular killer-mystry game Among us. Yet it is not the replica of it, but its player logic using s(CASP). This project is dedicated to replicate and model the agents(players)' behavior in the game as each individual and based how their perception of others and their known information.
